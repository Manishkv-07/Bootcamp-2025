                <lst>2.</lst>Before 1947, India was under British control for nearly 200 years. During this time, Indians were treated unfairly and had no control over their own country. Many great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played important roles in the freedom movement. They inspired people to fight peacefully or bravely against British rule and finally helped India become a free nation.
